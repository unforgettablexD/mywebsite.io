# Sudoku Solver with GUI

This project is a Sudoku solver implemented using the backtracking algorithm. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) as well as a text-based version.

## Instructions

To play Sudoku using the GUI, run the `GUI.py` file.

- Click a box and press a number on your keyboard to pencil in a number.
- To confirm the value, press the **ENTER** key on that box.
- To delete a penciled-in number, click **DEL**.
- To solve the board, press **SPACE** and watch the algorithm run.

## Sample Result
