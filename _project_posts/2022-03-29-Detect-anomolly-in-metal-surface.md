## Detection of Surface Imperfections in Planar Surfaces

Detection of surface imperfections in planar surfaces in the modern assembling process is a continuous area of examination. It has generally been difficult to ensure the absolute faultlessness of surfaces of carbon and iron combinations, or any surface for that matter.

The appearance and quality of surfaces in industrial products, such as metal sheets, are now held to particularly high standards. To meet these standards and ensure customer satisfaction, computer vision-based solutions are employed. These solutions involve utilizing 2D or 3D defect detection techniques like edge detection. When combined with a machine learning model, defects on various planar surfaces can be detected and classified.

The model is trained with a dataset of images that contain both damaged and undamaged surfaces. This ensures that the model can accurately identify defects, and in the absence of defects, recognize the surface as homogeneous. With proper training, these methods have proven to be robust and reliable in industrial settings, especially over the past few years.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were utilized to train the model to classify the imperfections effectively.
